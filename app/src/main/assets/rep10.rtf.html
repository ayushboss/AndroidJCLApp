  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">During the Second Punic War, Philip V of Macedon allied with Carthage and tried to seize Roman protectorates and naval bases in Illyria and invade Itaaly.</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">The Romans allied with the Aetolian League and, under Marcus Valerius Laevinus, defeated Philip V twice at Lamia in 209 BC. In 206, the Aetolian League made their own peace with Philip V, offending some Roman senators.</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">In 206, the Roman Sempronius Tuditanus negotiated with Philip V, leading to the Peace of Phoenike in 205 BC between Philip V and Rome.</span></li>

  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">In 200 BC, Publius Sulpicius Galba (who had commanded Roman forces in Greece during the First Macedonian War) was elected consul for the second time with Macedon as his province.</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">When Philip V tried to expand in Greece, Pergamum and Rhodes asked Rome for help. Publius Sulpicius Galba tried to get the Comitia Centuriata to declare war on Macdeon, but they rejected it at first. When Philip attacked more, the Romans declared war, and got the wary Aetolians to join in a year later.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">In 198 BC, the Romans elected Titus Quinctius Flamininus consul. Flamininus was fluent in Greek and proclaimed “Freedom and slef-determination of all Greeks”. Flamininus proposed a peace, after outmaneuvering Philip, that Philip refused.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3">The Battle of Aous River (198 BC)</span><span class="s1">: Flamininus defeats Philip V.</span></li>
