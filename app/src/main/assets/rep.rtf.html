<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li1">1)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Rome fought with her close neighbors: the Latins, Sabines, Hernici, Aequi, Volsci, and Etruscans.</li>
  <li class="li1">2)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Tarquinia and Veii attacked Rome right after Tarquinius Superbus was expelled, attempting to put him back on the throne. They were apparently defeated.</li>
  <li class="li1">3)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The Etruscan Lars Porsenna of Clusium attacked Rome next, and was apparently successful (though Roman historians deny it) in capturing the city.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <ol class="ol2">
    <li class="li1">a.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Myths: Horatius Cocles single-handedly holds off the soldiers of Clusium from the <i>Pons Sublicius</i>, saving Rome; Cloelia; Mucius Scaevola; etc.</li>
    <li class="li1">4)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1">Lake Regillus (496 BC)</span>: Rome fights the Latin League</li>
    <li class="li1">a.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The Roman commander was the dictator Aulus Postumius. On the Latin side, the former king Tarquinius Superbus and his son-in-law Mamillius Octavius of Tusculum led the Latin League.</li>
    <ol class="ol3">
      <li class="li1">i.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Mamillius Octavius might have died, I don’t know. Either way, a Latin commander died.</li>
    </ol>
    <li class="li1">b.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Castor and Pollux supposedly intervened, and Aulus Postumius ordered a forum to be built in their honor. A “Roman Victory” but really, the battle was indecisive.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
    <li class="li1">c.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>After the battle, the plebeian leader Spurius Cassius negotiated the <i>foedus Cassianum </i>(493 BC) with the Latins. It provided for a common defense drawn from both the Latin League and Rome.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>

    <li class="li1">8)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1">The Battle of Veii (396 BC)</span>: The dictator Marcus Furius Camillus (The “Second Founder of Rome”) takes the Etruscan city of Veii after a ten-year siege. He offers to spare the pepole of Veii. Camillus is painted red like Jupiter for his triumph.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
    <li class="li1">a.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Camillus later took Falerii, and was exiled to Ardea for not getting plunder and “embezzlement”.</li>
    <li class="li1">b.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Camillus was dictator five times.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>

    <li class="li1">10)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The city of Caere was an ally against Veii and had helped Rome during the Gallic attack by providing refuge for the Vestal Virgins. Rome exchanged private rights of citizenship with Caere. They did so with Massilia as well; Massilia had helped pay the Gallic ransom.</li>
    <li class="li1">11)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Tusculum became the first Roman <i>municipium</i> in 381 BC.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>

    <li class="li1">14)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Polybius says that Rome negotiated a treaty with Carthage in 509 BC, the first year of the Republic. Carthage could attack the Latin coast so long as they did not capture any of Rome’s allies or keep the booty from a Latin city subject to Rome.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
