<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Using native Spanish troops, Sertorius had consistently defeated provincial governors sent against him. He was an anti-Sullan, and hoped for reconciliation after Sulla’s death, but didn’t get it.</span></li>
  <ol class="ol2">
    <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">As governor of Spain, Sertorius accepted Spaniards and Lusitanians as Roman citizens, admitted their leaders into his opposition senate, and established a school to educate upper-class youths. He was generally very fair and just.</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Sertorius claimed a white fawn, a gift of Diana, gave him advice and followed him.</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Sertorius trained the Spaniards to fight in Roman style, but did not destroy their aptitude for guerilla warfare.</span></li>
  </ol>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">In 79 BC, Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius received the command against Sertorius.</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">When Pompey returned to Rome from defeating Lepidus, in 77 BC, he refused to disband his army and demnadd to be sent to Spain to fight Sertorius with Metellus Pius. Pompey fought Sertorius from 76 to 71 BC.</span></li>
  <ol class="ol2">
    <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Pompey was the largest owner in Picenum.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">At the age of 23, when Cinna refused to grant him his recognition, Pompey raised his own private army and joined Sulla.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Pompey killed Gnaeus Papirius Carbo in Africa, and refused to disband his victorious army when Sulla asked him too. He successfully petitioned Sulla for a triumph.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  </ol>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Sertorius defeated Pompey twice, and in one battle, Metellus saved his ass from being destroyed. But the traitor Perperna killed Sertorius.</span></li>
  <ol class="ol2">
    <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">In the peace settlemnt, Pompey assassinated Perperna and treated the Spaniards fairly, which they remembered gratefully.</span></li>
  </ol>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Pompey was seen by public opinion as the victor over Sertorius, though Metellus had been the more skillful tactitian.</span></li>
