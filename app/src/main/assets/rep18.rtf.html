<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">In 75 or 74 BC, Nicomedes IV of Bithynia willed Bithynia to the Roman People. The senate declared Bithynia a province, which provoked Mithridates VI of Pontus to prepare for war.</span></li>
  <ol class="ol2">
    <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Mithridates didn’t want Rome to control Bithynia.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">In 83-82 BC, Murena had touched off the brief Second Mithridatic War</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Mithridates had allied with his son-in-law Tigranes II of Armenia and with Sertorius as well as Cilican pirates. When Marcus Antonius (father of Marc Antony) could not check the pirates, they went to Pontus and helped build up Mithridates’ navy.</span></li>
  </ol>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Lucius Licinius Lucullus, a Sullan partisan who fought for Sulla in the civil war, got himself transferred from Cisalpine Gaul’s command to the command of Cilicia. Lucullus thus received the main command against Mithridates in the Third Mithridatic War.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <ol class="ol2">
    <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Lucullus’ co-consul was Marcus Aurelius Cotta, who was attacked by Mithridates at the inception of th Third Mithridatic War. Cotta had been reassigned to Bithynia.</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Lucullus’ fair terms in relieving the province of Asia of indemnity infuriated the financiers at Rome, who worked to take him down.</span></li>
  </ol>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Tigranes II of Armenia refused to surrender his father-in-law Mithridates when Lucullus demanded it, so Lucullus invaded Armenia in 69 BC without senatorial permission and captured the Armenian capital of Tigranocerta.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <ol class="ol2">
    <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Lucullus’ iron discipline and refusal to permit too much plunder made him unpopular and vulnerable to attack.</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Lucullus’ own brother-in-law, Clodius Pulcher, stirred up a mutiny against him.</span></li>
  </ol>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">At Zela in 67 BC, Mithridates annihilated two legions commanded by Lucullus’ legates.</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Pompey got himslef made supreme commander in the East, usurping Lucllus’ command against Mithridates, and ended the Third Mithridatic War.</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Lucullus brought back the apricot and cherry (<i>cerasus</i>) to Rome.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Spartacus and the Third Servile War (73- 71 BC)</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Spartacus, a Thracian slave at Capua, led some gladiators out of the training barracks at Capua and called upon farm slaves to join him. He eventually numbered 70,000 in his rebellion.</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">The senate appointed Marcus Licinius Crassus to defeat Spartacus.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <ol class="ol2">
    <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Crassus, Pompey and Lucullus had all been partisans of Sulla.</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Crassus had won the battle of the Colline Gate for Sulla.</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Crassus had many lucrative business deals, perhaps including a fire brigade.</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Crassus was famous for his willingness to defend anyone in court.</span></li>
  </ol>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Crassus pursued Spartacus to Bruttium and defeated the bulk of the slaves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <ol class="ol2">
    <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Pompey encountered 5000 escaping slaves in Etruria and crucified them along the <i>via Appia</i>. This allowed him to claim credit for “ending the war”.</span></li>
  </ol>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Pompey was six years too young to be consul, but he and Crassus were elected consuls together for 70 BC (they would be again in 55 BC).</span></li>
