This is the code for the Android version of our Junior Classical League Study Guide.

First published in 2016, "The JCL App" was a passion project pursued by me and a friend (akkim3). I primarily focused on Android development while akkim3 built the IOS Version. 

Although the IOS version of the application is no longer on the App Store due to the consistent costs of a developers liscense. However, the Android Version ("The JCL App") can still be found on the Play Store.
